Very basic AI text generator that allows you to create computer generated sentences from a txt file.


## Getting Started

- Download the ZIP file and add whatever txt files you want into the project folder. Run the TextGenerator.py file and select what file you want to generate text from.



## Hybrid Generation

- In order to generate text as a hybrid between 2 txt files, seperate the file numbers with "/".


## Longer Generations

- When prompted, you can type the ammount of words you want in  a given generation. This can be used to make books of your own :).
